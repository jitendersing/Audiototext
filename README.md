### **How It Works**
- Each **triple-backtick (` ``` `) block** gets a copy button on GitHub.
- The **copy button appears in GitHub's web interface** next to each code block.
- **There is no limit** to how many you can add.

### **Pro Tip**
To make your `README.md` more organized:
- Add **descriptive headers** (`## Title`) before each code block.
- Use **comments inside the code** for extra clarity.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you need more customizations. ðŸš€
